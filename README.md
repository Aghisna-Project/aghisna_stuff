## What is?
- just a command to make it easier for us to clone sources in one tap
## Note
- in this case I took the bootleggers rom example so the command is like this
- do this after you have prepared the repo and sync rom
## Usage

- To run this script, run the following command

```bash
  cd ..
  git clone -b btlg https://github.com/Aghisna-Project/aghisna_stuff.git btlg
  cd btlg
  bash ./otw.sh
```
